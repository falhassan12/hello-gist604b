# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Fadil Alhassan  
**Date:** 2025-10-23

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to create and manage repositories on GitHub, including adding files and committing changes.
- How Issues help teams collaborate by tracking tasks, bugs, and feature requests in a structured way.
- Why documentation matters in open source projects, as it guides other contributors and makes projects easier to maintain.

## Challenges and Solutions
I initially struggled with creating folders directly in GitHub, but I solved this by using the "Create new file" method, which automatically creates folders if they don’t exist. I also had to double-check markdown formatting to ensure headings and lists displayed correctly.

## Connection to My GIS Career
GitHub skills will help me in my GIS career by allowing me to manage and share geospatial projects, collaborate with other developers, and build a professional portfolio that showcases my GIS workflows and code.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions—similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
